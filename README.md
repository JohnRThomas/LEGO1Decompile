# LEGO Island Decompilation

***Are you ready to le?***

This project is an in-progress decompilation of the 1997 video game LEGO Island (specifically its main module LEGO1.DLL) into C++.

LEGO Island was initially written in Microsoft Visual C++ in 1995-1997, but no source code of the final game has ever been released.

The goals of this project are as follows:

* Produce clean, "human readable" C++ code that can be compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 (last to support Windows 95).
* Code compiles to a drop-in replacement for the retail LEGO1.DLL.
* Code is cleaned up or optimized where possible, provided the results remain accurate to the original functionality.

This project has just begun and will not produce any usable binaries yet. Please check back later.
